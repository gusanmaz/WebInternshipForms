# Internship Auto Form Generation Website

## Purpose

This website generates PDF internship form files for students by entering their student IDs. 
This is my first attempt to deal with internship related paperwork in my department.
You could read documentation of [my other (later) project](https://github.com/gusanmaz/InternshipFormGenerator) for automating paperwork to better
understand which problems this website tries to address.

Subjectively this website generates better internship forms for students, who are doing their
internship by working on a project from their homes, than Word form in .docx format 
provided by my university to be filled by students. Unfortunately use of forms generated by
this website is not approved for this semester because of differences in appearances between
two different kinds of forms. Therefore I started working on a [new project](https://github.com/gusanmaz/InternshipFormGenerator) that succeed in 
generating similar-looking forms and other internship related paperwork afterwards.

## Demo

You could check the website at [https://bmstajkolayform.guvencusanmaz.repl.co/](https://bmstajkolayform.guvencusanmaz.repl.co/)
The website asks for a student ID who is taking an internship project this summer semester.
You could use star student John Doe's ID of `1850506803` to generate internship PDF forms for him :relieved:

## Installation

All files needed to for the website could be under `dist` folder. You could run `npm run build`
to generate fresh *index.js* file needed by dist directory though it is not necessary. 

## Student Internship Data 
Internship data for a particular student could be fetched sending a get request to
`https://aqueous-shelf-29436.herokuapp.com/{studentID}.json` 
Change student ID value of the URL accordingly. Please note that you need your own similar server
if you need to adapt this website for your department.
